# Class-Attention-An-Improved-Profied-Attack-for-SM4-ALgorithm
Welcome to the repository for the paper “Class-Attention: An Improved Profiled Attack for SM4 Algorithm.” This work explores the application of a Transformer structure with a Class Token in the context of side-channel attacks. It lays the foundation for cross-device attacks using multimodal aligned features for side-channel attacks. We have also programmed firmware incorporating the SM4 algorithm mask and collected power traces.

Repository Overview

This repository is divided into two main parts:

Firmware Part

	•	Jupyter notebook files and Makefile used for power trace collection with ChipWhisperer.
	•	Firmware files with the masked SM4 algorithm for various platforms.
	•	Example power traces of the SM4 algorithm with masked key encryption.

Software Part

	•	Python files for the network structure.
	•	Python files used for measuring the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
	•	Python files used for implementing random delay.

Feel free to ask if you need any further modifications!
